Hi everyone!

This is **[oscillatingworks]**, and we love open source. Our mission is to find
exciting, independent, homemade open source software projects, work hand in hand
with their authors and take them to the next level.

Our action plan looks like this:

- We keep track of small and attractive indie open source projects and report on
  them using our **[compass]**.
- We discuss the adequacy of each submitted project and make a decision on what
  its next **[phase]** could be.
- In case we decide to keep on working on a project, we spend a considerable amount
  of time on understanding how it works from a technical point of view, finding
  its weakest points so we know the kind of work that it requires.
- We keep in touch with the authors and tell them our contribution plans and how they
  fit into author plans. Based on their feedback, we start actively working on the
  project.
- Once we become official maintainers of the project, we take care that it enjoys
  a healthy lifetime: we handle issues, publish new releases, review and merge pull
  requests, fix bugs, etc.

Our tasks are not limited to technical aspects â€“ we want to make projects more usable
and appealing for everyone so it implies working in other areas: branding, communication,
documentation, distribution, etc.

In case you are wondering who's behind the organization, there's no secrets here at all,
we are just normal **[people]** based in Berlin, Germany, with full-time jobs, doing this
during our spare time, addressing our passion in open source around a concrete idea and
philosophy.

And that's pretty much all for now. You can **[follow us on Twitter]** to get latest
updates, or **[write an email to us]** if you have any questions.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ‘Œ
